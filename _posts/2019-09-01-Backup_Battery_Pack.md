The battery pack can be charged using an 18V solar panel with a maximum charging current of 5A. The charging module uses the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method for charging the 3 cell Lithium battery pack. The output power of the battery is monitored by the Battery Management System (BMS) which is capable of a maximum current draw of 100A.

Batteries were arranged with 3 cell series, and 25 parallel(3s25p). The cells were spot-welded using the Spot welder, which I built during my last project. The 12V output of the battery can be connected to an inverter to convert the DC voltage into mains AC voltage. Interconnections of the components in the system are illustrated below.


I used Fusion360 to design the 3D printed enclosure by arranging all the parts in the system beforehand. This allowed me to optimize the component placement in tight space. Due to the limited space, steady airflow is critical for cooling the modules during operation, hence the 6mm cooling fan on the top.
