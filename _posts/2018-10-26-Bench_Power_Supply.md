Common lab bench power supplies are somewhat heavy and bulky, but don't get me wrong they are really powerful and convenient. Since I was in need of a power supply for some time I've decided to build one using the parts that are readily accessible like DPSxxxx power supply modules. I've designed the encloser using Fusion 360 and 3D print it. 

The DPS3012 is the main power control unit. Since It can handle input voltage up to 40VDC  I use 120-240VAC to 36VDC switching power converter as the supply. 

Although the DPS3012 can handle up to 12A of output current, the AC/DC converter I bought can only handle 5A. That limits the device from reaching its full capacity.
