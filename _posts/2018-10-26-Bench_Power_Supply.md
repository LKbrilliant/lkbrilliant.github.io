Most lab bench power supplies are somewhat heavy and bulky. But don't get me wrong, they are powerful and convenient. Since I needed a power supply for some time, I've decided to build one using parts that are readily accessible; like DPS power supply modules. I used the DPS3012 as the power control unit of my build. Since It can handle input voltages up to 40VDC, I used a 240VAC to 36VDC switching power converter as the supply.

Although the DPS3012 can handle up to 12A of output current, the AC/DC converter I bought can only supply 5A. That limits my device from reaching its maximum capacity.

I've designed the encloser using Fusion 360. When designing something for 3D printing, especially designing enclosures, it is a crucial step to model each physical part. Then we can position each model in space with enough clearance for wiring and model our encloser around parts. This process will save you a lot of time if otherwise wasted on mounting components on a poorly built case. After designing the enclosure, I 3D printed it on my Creality Ender 2 printer.
